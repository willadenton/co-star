        <h3>
            12/9/2021: You are developing the ability to respond emotionally. 
        </h3>
        <h4> 
            Not really sure what that means, especially after the day I had. Woof! 
            It's finals week and I can't wait for this to finally be over! Maybe this
            means I have a good cry coming my way, fingers crossed!
        </h4>
        <h3>
          12/10/2021: Don't hide and wait for it to pass. This time, too, can be light, joyful, and meaningful.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          What this means to me is is live in the present. I went to a birthday party tonight, and before I went I was
          waiting with some friend and at first I was bumming because I just wanted to go to the party, but once I stopped 
          focusing on that and I focused on being in the moment, I had a really fun time. 
        </h4>
        <h3>
          12/11/2021: You can't use radical honesty to escape responsibility. 
        </h3>
        <h4>
          So I looked up radical honesty, and that means to be completely honest all of the time. I think what that means is you can't 
          be honest all the time and expect not to have consequences, you are responsible for your words. So like if somoene asked me if
          I thought their shirt was cute and I said it was actually the ugliest shirt I've ever seen in my life, I can't
          be mad at them for not wanting to talk to me anymore. If I was, I'd be using radical honesty to escape the responsibility of dealing
          with the consequences of me just insulting someone's fit. 
        </h4>
        <h3>
          12/12/2021: You can always grow into a new self.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          I'm sure that I can and will, but right now I'm pretty content. This actually kind of relates to what I'm studying in philosophy and Sartre's idea of 'bad faith'.
          Like I made the choices I've made that make me who I am, and my existence precedes my essence. So I'll always be Willa, but the choices I make and my morals will likely
          continue to change as I get older. 
        </h4>
        <h3>
          12/13/2021: Try not to speak to yourself in a voice too nasty for anyone else.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          I really like this costar, I stay stuff like this to my friends all the time. Like if someone says something bad about themself that isn't true
          I say stop being mean to my friend! All the time I'm harder on myself then I would be on other people, like I say C's get degrees but like I would
          be so bummed if I got a C. So I should either stop saying that or accpet that I will infact get the same degree as everyone else with a C. I should also add that if provoked I can speak pretty nasty to other people.
